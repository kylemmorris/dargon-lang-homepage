        <p>
            Dargon is a statically-typed, imperitive, modular 
            programming language with a focus on expressiveness
            and safety. It compiles to an intermediate language (IL) which
            runs on a stack-based virtual machine called the Dargon 
            Virtual Machine (DVM). It takes inspiriation from a lot of 
            modern programming language design, including some aspects of 
            object-oriented, functional, and scripting languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            By <b>statically-typed</b>, we mean that every variable's type is
            known at compile time (when it's converted to IL). This is a 
            crucial part of Dargon's design - all variables must have a 
            type annotation associated with it. Coupled with this is the
            fact that Dargon is <b>strongly-typed</b>, meaning there is
            a robust type system.
        </p>
        <p>
            By <b>imperitive</b>, we mean that a Dargon program consists of
            <i>statements</i> which change the program's state. It is a 
            mix of <b>procedural</b> programming, for its simplicity, and
            <b>object-oriented</b> programming, for its valuable role in
            expressing abstract ideas. However, Dargon does not force you
            into any one particular paradigm like other languages. We 
            believe some paradigms are better for certain problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            By <b>modular</b>, we mean Dargon supports modularity in its
            build system. People can create Dargon modules (called libraries,
            or dlibs) that other people can then use without having to do
            any strenuous labor.

        <!-- Type System -->
        <h3 id="lex">Lexical Structure</h3>
        A Dargon source file (ending in *.dargon), is a sequence of ASCII
        characters. The DVM tokenizes this sequence using the following
        constructs.
